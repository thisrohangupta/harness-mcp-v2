Steps:
1. **Coverage analysis**: Call harness_get with resource_type="cost_commitment_coverage"${projectFilter} to see what percentage of compute is covered by commitments
2. **Utilization check**: Call harness_get with resource_type="cost_commitment_utilisation"${projectFilter} to see how well existing commitments are being used
3. **Savings realized**: Call harness_get with resource_type="cost_commitment_savings"${projectFilter} to quantify actual savings from commitments
4. **Detailed analysis**: Call harness_get with resource_type="cost_commitment_analysis"${projectFilter} for detailed breakdown by commitment type
5. **Estimated savings**: Call harness_get with resource_type="cost_estimated_savings"${projectFilter} to see potential additional savings
6. **Present findings**:
   - **Utilization rate**: Percentage of commitments being used (target >80%)
   - **Coverage rate**: Percentage of eligible compute covered (identify gaps)
   - **Wasted spend**: Dollar value of underutilized commitments
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Right-size existing commitments
     - Purchase additional commitments for uncovered high-usage resources
     - Convert commitment types (RI → Savings Plan) where beneficial
     - Let low-utilization commitments expire`,
